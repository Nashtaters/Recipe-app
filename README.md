# Overview

This is a recipe app that is used with a free API with a lot of different recipes/dishes.

I wrote this software in order to get a better understanding of node and react.

# Web Pages

There is only one web page, it works with an API that I found on the web.  When you search for certain recipes, it will show up on the page.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create this website.

I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  I also used React.

# Useful Websites

* [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

# Future Work

* I would love to implement a way for you to add your own recipe to this website.
* I plan on fixing up the calorie count so that it only displays to the nearest integer.
* I would like to implement a step-by-step guide on how to make the various dishes shown.
